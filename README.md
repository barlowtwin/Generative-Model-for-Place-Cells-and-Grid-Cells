# Generative-Model-for-Visualizing-Place-Cells-and-Grid-Cells



An attempt towards visualizing Grid Cells using the [Generative Temporal Memory with Spatial Memory for Partially Observed Environement](https://marcofraccaro.github.io/download/publications/generative-temporal-models-with-spatial-memory_icml2018.pdf). 


1. To create the dataset

- create a folder named 'Dataset'.
- Run the command python create_dataset.py
- Put the images in the folder.

2. Roam.py 
- For getting the movement of agent in the environment based on random actions.

3. config.py (for command line arguments)
- epochs 
- batch-size 
- gradient-clipping
- log-interval 
- save-interval 
- cuda
- seed
